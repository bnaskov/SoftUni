			<strong>Lord Howe Island</strong> <i>(formerly Lord Howe's Island)</i> is an irregularly crescent-shaped volcanic remnant in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, 600 kilometres (370 mi) directly east of mainland Port Macquarie, and about 900 kilometres (560 mi) from Norfolk Island. The island is about 10 km long and between <b>2.0 km</b> and <b>0.3 km</b> wide with an area of 14.55 km<sup>2</sup>, "of which only 398 hectares is in the lowland settled area". Along the west coast there is a sandy semi-enclosed sheltered coral reef lagoon. Most of the population lives in the north, while the south is dominated by forested hills rising to the highest point on the island, <b>Mount Gower</b> <sub>(875 m or 2,871 ft)</sub>.
