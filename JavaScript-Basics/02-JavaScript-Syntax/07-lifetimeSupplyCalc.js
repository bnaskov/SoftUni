﻿// Write a JavaScript function calcSupply(value) that accepts the following parameters:

// The function calculates how many of the food you will eat for the rest of your life. 
// Write JS program lifetimeSupplyCalc.js that calculates the amount of a few foods that you will eat.
// The result should be printed on the console.Run the program through Node.js.
// Note: we assume that there are no leap years.
